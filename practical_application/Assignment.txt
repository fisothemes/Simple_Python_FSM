Dr. Kujo is a worlds-famous expert in Marine Biology. 
He and his team have performed a large number of complex experiments. 
The results of these experiments are stored in the file 'results.txt'.

There are four rows of data in this file.

1st Row - is the experiment number.
2nd Row - is the day of the experiment, in the format 'dd.mm'.
3rd Row - is the time of the experiment, in the format 'hh.mm'.
4th Row - is the experimental data.

Dr Kujo wants a Python computer program using Python to analyse the experimental results. 
The program should read the data from the '.txt' file and also to write new data into another '.txt' file. 

The list of functions the program should perform is:

1. Read the data from the 'results.txt' file and display the data on the screen.

2. Do some basic data processing, such as:
	i.  Finding the maximum and the minimum value of the experimental results.
	ii. Calculate the average value and the standard deviation value of the experimental results.
	iii.Calculate how many experiments resulted in values greater than some input value.
	vi. Sort the experiments data in ascending and descending order.

3. Process the data according to functions in 2. for a portion of data specified by the user.
   e.g. for all data between certain times, or for all data on a specific date, or for data for experiment 
   numbers <x> to <y>).

4. Return the experiment number, the day and the time for any individual experiment value requested by the 
   user, in the format: 

	“The value <w> has been found in experiment number <x> which was performed on day <y> at time <z>” 
   
   If the value does not match any of the experiment’s data values, the information for the value closest 
   to the input value should be returned.
